# E-DASH-Android
### Description


E-Dash : E-Dash is the name of our project that I, and three of my colleagues, realized as part of our ESPRIT training. The project boils down to automating the process of mixing aromas to obtain an "E-Juice" for electronic cigarettes smokers. To do this, the project was divided into three main parts.

- Mobile part : Realize with Android to offer a mobile application, which not only made it possible to offer an "E-Liquid" recipe sharing space and browse all the information about the "E-Juice" for the users, but also it provided a connection To the E-Dash device, which we designed and manufactured, to create the desired "E- Liquid".
